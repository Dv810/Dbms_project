**# Dbms_project**
This project is an Attendance Management System implemented using a relational database model.\
It leverages an Entity-Relationship (E-R) diagram to organize and manage data efficiently.\ 

**#The database includes the following entities:**

**Students:** Stores details such as student ID, roll number, and name.\
**Courses:** Manages course information, including course ID, title, and credits.\
**Faculty:** Contains faculty credentials (username, password) and personal information (ID and name).\
**Session:** Tracks session-specific details like session ID, term, and year.\

**#Key relationships include:**

**Registered:** Links students with their enrolled courses.\
**Teaches:** Connects faculty with the courses they teach.\
**Attendance:** Tracks student attendance for specific sessions.\
This database system aims to streamline attendance tracking, course registration, and session management while ensuring secure faculty authentication.\
